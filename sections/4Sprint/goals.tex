\subsubsection{Overall Sprint Goals}
The goals for sprint 4 were different from sprint 3, in that focus was put on documentation rather than development of new features. This was done to make it easier for next year's students to take over the project and quickly understand the product and process we created.
Some issues were included, however, specifically picked by the PO group to be the last functionality added to the application. On top of this there was focus on fixing remaining bugs and release issues. 

\subsubsection{Our Sprint Goals}
As mentioned, in this sprint each group was assigned one development task at the beginning of the sprint. Our task consisted of two issues concerning a timer for activities. Aside from this, we worked on fixing some bugs from the release and changes related to the Azure Pipelines.

Overall, we worked with the following issues:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Backend Workshop.
    \item Issue \#209: Bug "Giving wrong login credentials will crash the application."
    \item Issue \#2: User story "As a citizen I want a timer so that I know how long is left of my current activity."
    \item Issue \#61: User story "As a guardian I would like to be able to add a timer to an activity so that the citizen can see how much time is to be spent on this activity."
    \item Azure Pipelines update.
\end{itemize}
