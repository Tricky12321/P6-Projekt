\chapter{Sprint 4}
The fourth sprint ran from April 30th until May 15th. Like sprint 3, this sprint started with a sprint introduction meeting, where the PO group presented the product vision and which issues needed to be completed. Since this was the last sprint, the PO group had picked specific issues and assigned them to the development groups at the start of the sprint.  

It was agreed that after the sprint ended, no one was to touch the code. This was to make sure that we had a definitive final version to hand over to next year's students, instead of different groups adding small things here and there. It also meant that each group's report was based on the same final version, making it easier for next year's students to figure out what the status of the system is.
