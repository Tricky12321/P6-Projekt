\section{Release hotfix}
During the release preparation, there were some problems discovered after the release was made, and there has to be made some hotfixes. This included that the app sometimes crashed when logging in with wrong credentials. This was a bug that occurred when the logout feature was merged with the loading spinner and Wrong username and/or password dialog on the login screen. This was fixed in a hotfix that was pushed to master, a few days later, and came as a release fix. 
\todo{Should this be here, or is it too technical?}
The fix was to remove the context form auth bloc and changing how the loading spinner and logout functionality works.
