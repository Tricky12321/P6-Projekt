\section{Issue \#48: Continued Development of Loading Spinner}
This section describes the loading spinner part of issue \#48, about showing a loading spinner on the login screen when waiting for a response. This was requested because the user does not know whether the screen is frozen or just waiting, when logging in and waiting for a response. 
 
The loading spinner was made as a dialog that can be overlaid anywhere in the app.
 
The loading spinner should be able to timeout after a given period, and then call a method when timed out. This was achieved by calling a callback method when a timer was done. 

An image of the loading spinner can be seen on figure~\ref{fig:loadingSpinner}.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
The loading spinner was implemented as a dialog, that was shown with a loading circle. This was done so it could be used anywhere in the app. To allow the loading spinner to timeout, we implemented a callback timer so that, after a given amount of time, a void method with no parameters was called. This allowed for the functionality that, after a certain amount of time, the loading spinner would disappear and the callback method would be called.
