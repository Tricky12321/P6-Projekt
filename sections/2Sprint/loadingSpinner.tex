\section{User story 48: Continued Development of Loading Spinner}
This section describes the loading spinner part of user story 48, about a loading spinner on the login screen, when waiting for a response. This was requested because the user does not know whether the screen is frozen or just waiting, when logging in and waiting for a response. 
 
The loading spinner was made as a dialog that can be overlayed anywhere in the app.
 
The loading spinner should be able to timeout after a given period, and then call a method when timed out. This was achieved using a callback method with a timer. 

An image of the loading spinner can be soon on figure~\ref{fig:loadingSpinner}.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
The loading spinner is implemented as a dialog, that is shown with a Loading circle. This was done so that it could be used anywhere in the app. To allow the loading spinner to timeout, we implemented a callback timer, that after a given amount of time, a void method, with no parameters is called. This allows for functionality that after a certain time, the loading spinner will disappear and the callback method will be called.
