\section{Issue \#88: Notification Dialog}
\label{sect:NotifyDialog}
As part of the improved login screen, described in section~\ref{sect:loginScreenFlutter}, we were assigned an additional issue, consisting of the task: "Create a notification widget to avoid duplicated code.". 
This notification widget was desired to be used to notify the user that they have attempted to login with incorrect login information, but should also be usable anywhere else in the application where a notification might be used.
The design of the widget should follow the design guide made by the PO-group, which contained the exact design of the notification dialog. 
The result of the notification dialog can be seen on figure~\ref{fig:notificationDialog}.

        {A notification dialog notifying the user of a given message.} %Caption
        {fig:notificationDialog} %Label
        
Since the dialog is only used as a notification, it has no interesting functionality. The functionality of the "Okay" button is simply to close the dialog.
