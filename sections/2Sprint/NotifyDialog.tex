\section{User story 88: Notification Dialog}
\label{sect:NotifyDialog}
As part of the improved login screen, described in section~\ref{sect:LoginScreenFlutter}, we were assigned an additional issue: "As a developer I would like a notification widget so that I avoid duplicated code". 
This notification widget should in this context be used to notify the user that they have attempted to login with incorrect login information.
The design of the widget should follow the design guide made by the PO-group, which contained the exact design of the notification dialog. 
\todo{correct the image when the updated button are implemented and correct title and description to notification title and description} The result of the notification dialog can be seen on figure~\ref{fig:NotificationDialog}.
