\chapter{2. Sprint}
The second sprint ran from March 18th 2019 until April 8th 2019.
This sprint started a bit different from the first sprint. A sprint planning meeting was held, but this time all groups were not assigned user stories directly, as was the case in the first sprint. This sprint, every group had the opportunity to choose their own user stories, where the user stories available for selection were limited to high and highest priority. During this sprint, each group was responsible for the estimation of which user stories the group would be able to successfully carry out. This means no group should be taking more user stories than they were able to complete within the time frame of the sprint.


%The new developer process that we changed to in sprint 1, allowed groups to pick user stories when needed, instead of getting them assigned in the beginning of the sprint.
