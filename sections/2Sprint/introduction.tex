\chapter{Sprint 2}
The second sprint ran from March 18th 2019 until April 8th 2019.
This sprint started a bit differently from the first sprint. A sprint introduction meeting was held instead of sprint planning, as described in section~\ref{sect:teamRetrospectiveSprint1}. This time all groups were not assigned issues directly, as was the case in the first sprint. This sprint, every group had the opportunity to choose their own issues, where the issues available for selection were limited to high- and highest-priority issues. During this sprint, each group was responsible for the estimation of which issues the group would be able to successfully carry out. This meant that no group should be taking more issues than they were able to complete within the time frame of the sprint.

%The new developer process that we changed to in sprint 1, allowed groups to pick user stories when needed, instead of getting them assigned in the beginning of the sprint.
