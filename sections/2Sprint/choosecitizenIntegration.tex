\section{User story 47: Continued Integration of Choose Citizen Screen}
This sections describes the continuous work of integrating the choose citizen screen in the application. From last sprint, we were missing to direct to the choose weekplan screen, from the choose citizen screen. This feature was not implemented in the last sprint, because it was dependent on both our user story and the user story for choosing a weekplan being done. However, the routing between the two screens were finished in release preparation, where both the user stories were complete and merged into release. Testing for the choose citizen screen was also completed in this sprint, allowing us to merge the screen into the release.
