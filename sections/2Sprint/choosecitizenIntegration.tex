\section{Issue \#47: Integration of Choose Citizen Screen}
This section describes the continuous work of integrating the choose citizen screen in the application. 
From last sprint, what was missing was to direct from the choose citizen screen to the choose weekplan screen when choosing a citizen. This feature was not implemented in the last sprint, because it was dependent on the issues for both of these screens to be done. 

The routing between the two screens was done after the issues involving the two screens were finished.
Now, when choosing a citizen on the choose citizen screen, the user would be directed to the screen containing the weekplans for that citizen.




%The routing between the two screens were finished in release preparation, where both the issues were complete and merged into release. Testing for the choose citizen screen was also completed in this sprint, allowing us to merge the screen into the release.
