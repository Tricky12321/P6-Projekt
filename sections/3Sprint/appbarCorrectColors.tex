\section{User Story 201: Correct App Bar Colors}
With some fiddling around with the app bar widget, we found out that we could easily correct the simple singular orange color of the app bar, to have the gradient colors documented in the design guide, with the result of having a more pleasant appearance. We proposed this change to the PO-group and they agreed that it was a nice and needed change. They decided to create an issue accordingly, which we were assigned, allowing us to merge this design change.
