\section{Issue \#201: Correct App Bar Colors}
While looking through the code of the app bar widget during release preparation, we found that we could easily correct the simple singular orange color of the app bar to have the gradient colors documented in the design guide, resulting in a more pleasant appearance. We proposed this change to the PO-group and they agreed that it was needed. They decided to create this issue accordingly, which consisted of the task: "The app bar should have correct colors so that it fits the design guide". We were assigned the issue, allowing us to implement this design change. The app bar with the new color can be seen on figure~\ref{fig:appBarNewColor}.
