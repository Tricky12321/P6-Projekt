\section{Issue \#137 and \#138: Loading Spinner and Notification Dialog During Login}
These issues concerned the showing of a loading spinner when waiting for a response from the API when logging in, and the showing of a notification dialog when a login fails.
The 'Notify Dialog' was used as the alert shown when entering incorrect information into the username and password fields and attempting to login. This was an important feature to have, since without it, the user did not know whether the server was down or if the username or password was incorrect. 

This issue was dependent on the loading spinner created for issue \#48, and the 'Notify Dialog' from issue \#88. These were implemented together because after the loading spinner had been shown, the 'Notify Dialog' was then shown with a descriptive message.

Figure~\ref{fig:wrongusernamepassword} shows how the dialog is rendered when a wrong username or password is entered, and prompts, in danish, with the title "Error" and the description "Wrong username and/or password". The loading spinner looks as previously shown on figure~\ref{fig:loadingSpinner}.

In addition to this, some security was added to the login screen to limit the amount of attempts a user can do. This is done when a wrong username or password is entered and login is pressed. The loading spinner will then run for 2 seconds before the message is shown, which means that the most a single application can do is a request every 2 seconds. This makes brute forcing using the application much more difficult. However, if the correct username and password is entered, the login will happen before the 2 seconds.

\subsubsection{Testing}
In order to test the new parts of the login screen, tests were written to press the buttons and test if logging in with wrong information showed the Dialog. This was written as integration tests, that fills a wrong username and password into the username and password text fields. When this is done the login button is pressed, and checked if a Giraf Notify Dialog is shown.
