\section{User story 138: Show an alert when trying to log in with the wrong information}
This user story was about the alert shown when entering incorrect information into the username and password fields and attempting to login. This was an important feature to have, since before this was implemented, the user did not know whether the server was down or if the username or password was incorrect. 

This user story was dependent on the Loading spinner from user story 48, and the Giraf Notify Dialog from user story 88. This is because after the Loading spinner has been shown, the Giraf Notify Dialog is then shown with a descriptive message.

Figure~\ref{fig:wrongusernamepassword} shows how the dialog is rendered when wrong username or password is entered. 

In addition to this, some security was added to the login screen to limit the amount of attempts a user can do. This is done when a wrong username or password is entered and login is pressed. The loading spinner will then run for 2 seconds before the message is shown, which means that the most a single app can do is a request every 2 seconds. This makes brute forcing using the app much more difficult. However, if the correct username and password is entered, the login will happen before the 2 seconds.

\subsubsection{Testing}
In order to test the new parts of the login screen, tests were written to press the buttons and test if logging in with wrong information showed the Dialog. This was written as integration tests, that fills a wrong username and password into the username and password text fields. When this is done the login button is pressed, and checked if a Giraf Notify Dialog is shown.
