\section{Issue \#166: Logout uses Confirm Dialog}
This issue consisted of the task: "Logout button needs to use Confirm Dialog", regarding the alert shown when trying to log out of the application. Before, a standard alert message was shown, with the possibility of closing the message or confirming the logout. 
Because this type of action was either a cancellation or a confirmation, it was possible to use the newly implemented Confirm Dialog.

Integrating the Confirm Dialog simply meant replacing the existing one by instead showing the Confirm Dialog. The dialog was given, in danish, the title "Log out", description "Do you want to log out?", confirm button text "Log out" and a logout icon on the confirm button. 
%When the Confirm Dialog was accepted, it was an easy job to replace the alert message with our Confirm Dialog. The Confirm Dialog was given the information to display and the logic that the confirmation button should execute. 
The results of integrating the Confirm Dialog for the logout feature is shown on figure~\ref{fig:ConfirmDialogLogout}.
