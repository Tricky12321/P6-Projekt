\subsubsection{Overall Sprint Goals}
The goals for sprint 3 were very similar to the goals for sprint 2. Development still aimed towards increased functionality, stability and usability. This meant implementing more issues to improve the application. On top of this, there was a high priority on completing unfinished issues from previous sprints.

\subsubsection{Our Sprint Goals}
In the third sprint, there was focus on finishing our unfinished issues, and connecting these and our previous issues with the application. 
On top of this, we also received some new issues. 
For this sprint, we worked with the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Issue \#11 (web-api): Task "Back-end returns $\sim$~1 GB data on every pictogram search."
    \item Issue \#53: User story "As a guardian, I would like to be able to re-order the activities in a week plan, so I can easily re-prioritize the activities for the citizen."
    \item Issue \#108: Task "Missing tests for issue \#88."
    \item Issue \#137: Task "A loading spinner should be shown when logging in (waiting for response from API)"
    \item Issue \#138: Task "Show an alert when trying to log in with the wrong information."
    \item Issue \#158: Task "Create a confirmation widget to avoid duplicated code."
    \item Issue \#166: Task "Logout button needs to use Confirm Dialog."
    \item Issue \#194: Bug "Inconsistent font size in citizen selection."
    \item Issue \#201: Task "The app bar should have correct colors so that it fits the design guide."
\end{itemize}
