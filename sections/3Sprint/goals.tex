\subsubsection{Overall Sprint Goals}
The goals for sprint 3 were very similar to the goals for sprint 2. Development still aimed towards increased functionality, stability and usability. This meant implementing more user stories to improve the application. On top of this, there was a high priority on completing unfinished user stories from previous sprints.


\subsubsection{Our Sprint Goals}
In the third sprint, there was focus on finishing our unfinished issues, and connecting these and our previous issues with the application. 
On top of this, we also received some new issues.
