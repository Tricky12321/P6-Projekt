\section{User Story 6: Improve Choose Citizen Screen Xamarin}
\label{sect:chooseCitizenXamarin}
As the development shifted from adding new features to focus on bug fixing and usability, we were reassigned to a smaller task, that would make room for fixing existing bugs when encountered.
This sections concerns the user story: as a guardian I would like the user selection screen to look better so it makes it easier for me to find the correct user.

The figure~\ref{fig:xamarinLoginScreen} shows the choose citizen screen from previous development. Here, all of the users were put in a list. This meant that a lot of the screen was not being used in the view, and finding a specific user would require a lot of scrolling.
The improved choose citizen screen should be updated and resemble the prototype as seen on figure~\ref{fig:loginScreenPrototype}.

The user story was therefore mostly about refactoring, focusing on updating the design of the choose citizen view in the Xamarin application. As it was decided shortly after being assigned the user story, that GIRAF should be rewritten to Flutter, the time spent on this user story was minimal. The user story we were assigned afterwards was nearly the same, but this time it was to implement the choose citizens screen from scratch.
