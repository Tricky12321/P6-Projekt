\section{Issue \#6: Improve Citizen Selection Screen Xamarin}
\label{sect:chooseCitizenXamarin}
As the development shifted from adding new features to focus on stability and usability, we were reassigned to a smaller issue, that would make room for fixing existing bugs when encountered.
This issue concerns the user story: "As a guardian I would like the user selection screen to look better so it makes it easier for me to find the correct user".

The figure~\ref{fig:xamarinLoginScreen} shows the citizen selection screen from the previous release. Here, all of the users were put in a list. This meant that a lot of the screen was unused in the view, and finding a specific citizen could require a lot of scrolling.
The improved citizen selection screen should be updated and resemble the prototype as seen on figure~\ref{fig:loginScreenPrototype}.

The issue was therefore mostly about refactoring, focusing on updating the design of the citizen selection screen in the Xamarin application. As it was decided shortly after being assigned the issue, that GIRAF should be rewritten in Flutter, the time spent on this issue was minimal. The issue we were assigned afterwards was nearly the same, but this time it was to implement the citizen selection screen from scratch in Flutter.
