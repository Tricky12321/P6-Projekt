\section{User Story 48: Create Login Screen}
\label{sect:LoginScreenFlutter}
%Since the choose citizen user story did not require more than one pair in our pair programming development, we needed an extra user story. 
After getting familiar with Flutter by programming together as a group, we decided to pick an additional user story:
"As a guardian I would like a better login screen so that the application is more appealing". This user story presented the task of improving the login screen to have a more pleasant look, meaning that it was mostly design related. 
This issue have the following associated tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensure that login works correctly (cannot login with incorrect information).
    \item Ensure that login matches prototype and design guide.
    \item A loading spinner is shown while contacting API, so the user does not think the app is frozen.
\end{itemize}

The PO-group attached a prototype for this user story, which displayed how the login screen should look.

The existing login screen at the time was temporarily made by the group that implemented the core functionality, as mentioned in section~\ref{sect:XamarinToFlutter}, to access other parts of the application, allowing other groups to develop these other parts. 
This means that the first task of the user story, the login functionality, was already implemented, leaving us with the task of re-designing the login screen and implementing the loading spinner. 

The re-design of the login screen was changed to resemble the look of the prototype, and can be seen on figure~\ref{fig:loginscreenNewLandscape}.

\figur  {H} %Placement

        {sections/1Sprint/images/loginScreen_new_landscape.jpg} %Filepath
        {Landscape login screen after the remake.} %Caption
        {fig:loginscreenNewLandscape} %Label

The functionality for the loading spinner was developed, but tests were not written in time for it to be included in the first sprint. Additionally, it also needed to be integrated into the application to work properly. This was pushed to the next sprint.
