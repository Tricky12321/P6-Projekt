\section{Issue \#48: Create Login Screen}
\label{sect:loginScreenFlutter}
%Since the choose citizen user story did not require more than one pair in our pair programming development, we needed an extra user story. 
After getting familiar with Flutter by programming together as a group, we decided to pick an additional issue, consisting of the user story:
"As a guardian I would like a better login screen so that the application is more appealing". This user story presented the problem of improving the login screen to have a more pleasant look, meaning that it was mostly design related. 
This user story was divided into the following sub-tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensure that login works correctly (cannot login with incorrect information).
    \item Ensure that login matches prototype and design guide.
    \item A loading spinner is shown while contacting API, so the user does not think the app is frozen.
\end{itemize}

The PO group attached a prototype for this issue, which displayed how the login screen should be designed.

The existing login screen at the time was temporarily made by the group that implemented the core functionality, as mentioned in section~\ref{sect:XamarinToFlutter}, to give access to other parts of the application, allowing other groups to develop these other parts. 
This means that the first task of the user story, the login functionality, was already implemented, leaving us with the task of redesigning the login screen and implementing the loading spinner. 

The redesign of the login screen was changed to resemble the look of the prototype, and can be seen on figure~\ref{fig:loginscreenNewLandscape}.

        {fig:loginscreenNewLandscape} %Label

The functionality of the loading spinner was developed, but tests were not written in time for it to be included in the first sprint. Additionally, it also needed to be integrated into the application to work properly. This integration was postponed to the next sprint.
