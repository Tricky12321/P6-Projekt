\section{Sprint Review}
This section discusses the review of the product both overall for the GIRAF project and the work completed in our group.

\subsubsection{Overall Sprint Review}
According to the process manual, a sprint review should be held like described in section~\ref{sect:scrum}.
This was held at the end of sprint one, where the PO group was present along with one spokesperson from each group. 
Here, every spokesperson informed the other groups about the status of the implementation of the development group's issues.
This sprint review deviated a bit from how the process manual describes a sprint review. Since the sprint review was held only one week after shifting the application from Xamarin to Flutter, no issues were fully implemented yet. Because of this, the review did not include the part where the PO group accepts or rejects issues. This was also the reason behind the decision not to release anything this sprint.

\subsubsection{Our Sprint Review}
During the first week of development using the Flutter framework, we as a group had a total of two issues. This part of the sprint review will only cover the Flutter issues, as the Xamarin issues did not lead to any implementation.
During the first week after the shift to Flutter we made a lot of progress on the UI part of the two issues. However, some of the tasks in the issues were not yet fully implemented. A list of finished and unfinished issues is shown below.

\subsubsection{Finished}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Issue \#47: User story "As a guardian I would like to be able to choose a citizen so that I can choose who I’m editing the week plan for."}
    \subitem Make a screen to list all citizens.
    \subitem Make/Use a BLoC to handle the data.
    \subitem Make a widget to standardize how to show a citizen.
    
    \item \textbf{Issue \#48: User story "As a guardian I would like to be able to log into the system using a username and password, so that I can see my associated citizens."}
    \subitem Ensure that login works correctly (cannot login with incorrect information).
    \subitem Ensure that login matches prototype and design guide.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unfinished}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Issue \#47: User story "As a guardian I would like to be able to choose a citizen so that I can choose who I’m editing the week plan for."}
    \subitem When  choosing  a  citizen  I  should  be  routed  to  the  weekplan selection  screen.
    \subitem Tests need to be created for the feature.
    
    \item \textbf{Issue \#48: User story "As a guardian I would like to be able to log into the system using a username and password, so that I can see my associated citizens."}
    \subitem A loading spinner should be shown while contacting the API, so the user does not think the app is frozen.
    \subitem Tests need to be created for the feature.
\end{itemize}

The development of unfinished issues were continued in the next sprint.
