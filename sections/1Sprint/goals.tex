\section{Sprint Goals}
In this section, the goals for sprint one will be discussed. This includes the overall goals and our goals for the GIRAF project's first sprint.

\subsubsection{Overall Sprint Goals} 
\label{sect:1SprintGoals}
During the first sprint, there was a shift in goals. Initially, both issues with new functionality and issues with improvements on existing functionality were included. These were based on remaining issues from the previous year. Later on in the sprint, the goals shifted to focus on stability and usability, as described in section~\ref{sect:projectGoals}.
Soon after, it was decided that application development should be done in Flutter instead of Xamarin, which meant that the entire front end had to be rewritten in Flutter.
After the core of the application had been implemented in Flutter, the goals stabilised into issues of rewriting additional features and improvement of stability and usability.

\subsubsection{Our Sprint Goals}
Due to the shift in overall goals throughout the sprint, the issues we ended up working with also changed throughout the sprint. Firstly, at the sprint planning meeting, we were assigned an issue consisting of the user story of making the weekplanner application available offline.
After changing focus to stability and usability, we then received an issue of improving the UI of the citizen selection screen in the weekplanner application. This was combined with the rewriting of the citizen selection screen after the decision to switch to Flutter.

Overall, the work we covered in this sprint was:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Issue \#9: User story "As a guardian, I would like that the app is fully available offline so that I can still use it if the internet is down."
    \item Issue \#6: User story "As a guardian I would like the choose citizen screen to look better so it makes it easier for me to find the correct user."
    \item Adapting to the change from Xamarin to Flutter.
    \item Issue \#47: User story "As a guardian I would like to be able to choose a citizen so that I can choose who Iâ€™m editing the week plan for."
    \item Issue \#48: User story "As a guardian I would like to be able to log into the system using a username and password, so that I can see my associated citizens."
\end{itemize}
