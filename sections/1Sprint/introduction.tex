\chapter{Sprint 1}
In the following chapter, we discuss the development done in the first sprint.
The first sprint ran from February 25th 2019 until March 15th 2019.

The sprint started with a sprint planning meeting where each development group were assigned an issue, and had to estimate the time it would take to complete that issue.
