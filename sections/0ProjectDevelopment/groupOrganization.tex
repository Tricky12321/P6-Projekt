\section{Group Organization}
In the previous year, each group was assigned an area of responsibility:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Front end
    \item Back end
    \item Server
    \item Scrum
    \item Product Owner
\end{itemize}

However, they found it difficult to distribute knowledge between groups and advised against this structure. Instead, they advised the use of full stack groups, where each group works with all parts of the product by implementing user stories. This was the structure chosen to organise groups in this semester. However, to retain some of the benefits of dedicated groups, three skill groups were created across development groups. Each development group had one specialised skill member for each of the topics: 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l|X}
\hline
 Front end  & Discuss and share knowledge about front end of the GIRAF client application.  \\ \hline
 Back end   & Discuss and share knowledge about the API, the communication with the database, the clients' communication with the API and the clients' back end.   \\ \hline
 Server     & Discuss and share knowledge about which servers are necessary, their functionality and the maintenance of them.\\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The skill groups were an attempt to improve communication between development groups, while still allowing the development groups themselves to discuss the development of all three parts of the product. An illustration of the distribution into skill groups can be seen on figure~\ref{fig:skillGroups}, where each development group (vertical) has one member in the front end group (green), back end group (red) and server group (blue). The rest of the development group members are not assigned to any skill group (grey).

Despite the change to full stack groups and skill groups for the different parts of the product, process and product owner responsibility was still assigned to two of the development groups, similar to last year. The process group had the responsibility of making decisions about and controlling the process, while the PO group had the responsibility of being in contact with the customers to find requirements and make sure the product fits the customers' needs.
