Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) features a number of inherent psychological disorders that affects development, communication and behavior. ASD can be diagnosed at any age, but is named a development disorder since the symptoms are often spotted child ages \citep{cite:NIMH}. Symptoms include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Having a hard time communicating with other people.
    \item Restricted interests and prone to repetitive behaviors.
    \item Symptoms that prohibit the person to function well in work, school and other areas.
\end{itemize} \citep{cite:NIMH}

It is estimated that 0.6-1\% of the citizens in Denmark has an ASD,
with worldwide estimation of 1\% \citep{cite:SundedDK} \citep{cite:AutismSociety}.
People that have an ASD, often needs help with structuring their daily life. This could either be in form of daily schedules in a physical form, or an electronic schedule \citep{cite:NIMH}. 
This project regards the development of Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folks (GIRAF) which features tools that people with ASD can use to structure their daily life.
