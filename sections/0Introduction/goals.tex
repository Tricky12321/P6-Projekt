Early in this semester, the PO-group arranged meetings with the stakeholders of the GIRAF project. Both parties expressed that a stable release of the system should be highly prioritized. Therefore, the early sprints of the GIRAF were focused on finishing a release of the system that was stable and fit for use.

To ensure the build would progress towards a stable release, groups of the GIRAF project all agreed to fix any small bugs encountered. The definition of a small bug in this case was if fix time of the bug was estimated to $\sim$5 minutes or lower. If the bug was not fixable withing this period, the groups were encouraged to create an issue on the Github page, and these bugs would then be fixed in the next sprint or by groups with excess time in their sprint.

In addition to this, the stakeholders emphasized that the apps of the GIRAF project should have a high level of usability. The reason for this is that the stakeholders expressed concerns that their less IT familiar employees would have a hard time maneuvering and using a complex application, and as a consequence might end up not using the system at all.

So the primary goals of the early sprints were to have a stable release, with a high level of usability.
