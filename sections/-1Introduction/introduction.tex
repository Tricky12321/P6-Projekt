Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) includes a number of inherent psychological disorders that affects development, communication and behaviour. ASD can be diagnosed at any age, but is named a development disorder since the symptoms are often noticed in the childhood years \citep{cite:NIMH}. Symptoms include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Having difficulty communicating with other people.
    \item Restricted interests and prone to repetitive behaviour.
    \item Symptoms that prohibit the person to function well in work, school and other areas.
\end{itemize} \citep{cite:NIMH}

It is estimated that 0.6-1\% of the citizens in Denmark are diagnosed with ASD, with a worldwide estimation of 1\% \citep{cite:SundedDK} \citep{cite:AutismSociety}.
People who suffer from ASD often need help with structuring their daily life. This can either be in the form of daily schedules in a physical form, or an electronic schedule \citep{cite:NIMH}. 
This project regards the development of Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folks (GIRAF) which features tools that people with ASD can use to structure their daily life.
